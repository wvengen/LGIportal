LGIportal
=========

LGIportal is a web interface for the [Leiden Grid Infrastructure][LGI2] that
doesn't require authentication by client-side certificates (which LGI's
basic\_interface portal does).

For each user, an LGI certificate and key should be installed in the portal,
which is used to connect to an LGI project server.

For install instructions, please see [INSTALL][].
